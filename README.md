# Awesome Startup

## Description
This app is for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. 
They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

## API Reference
We use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. Please visit for more info on how to use https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto.
